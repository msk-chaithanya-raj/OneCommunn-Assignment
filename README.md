## Technologies Used

### **React**

- React is used as the JavaScript library to build the user interface (UI).
- It enables the creation of reusable UI components, making the codebase modular and maintainable.

### **JSX (JavaScript XML)**

- JSX is used to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, making it easier to define UI components.
- It allows the combination of HTML and JavaScript in a single file, which React then transforms into regular JavaScript.

### **TypeScript (TSX)**

- TypeScript is used to add type safety to JavaScript code. It helps catch errors early during development and improves the maintainability of the application.
- **TSX**: This is the TypeScript version of JSX, allowing you to write strongly typed React components with JSX syntax.

### **CSS**

- CSS is used to style the components and layout of the application.
- **Tailwind CSS** is used to style components with utility-first classes, making it easier to create responsive designs without writing custom CSS.

### **Tailwind CSS**

- Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to create responsive and customizable designs by applying utility classes directly to HTML elements.
- It helps build consistent and scalable UI components faster.

### **Flexbox**

- Flexbox is employed to create flexible, responsive layouts.
- It allows easy positioning and alignment of items within a container.
